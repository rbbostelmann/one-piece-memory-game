# One Piece Manga Cover Memory Game

I only used the first 6 volume covers since this was meant to be a side project. If/when I decide to expand I can add the option to add/select covers, or to visualize extra info about particular volumes.

Anyway, it was a fun project!

# Issues

The main problem I ran into was when making the "Play Again" button, I just wanted it to shuffle and unflip the cards by removing their "flip" classes - which I managed to do just fine -, but then they also became unresponsive and that I could not fix.

Now the button reloads the page instead, which is a non-optimal but quick fix until I can learn what was wrong.

Have fun!
